==========================

   :description lang=en: Automate building, versioning, and hosting of your
    technical documentation continuously on Read the Docs.


Dear PyGui is an easy-to-use, dynamic, GPU-Accelerated, cross-platform graphical
user interface (GUI) framework for Python. At the core it is considered an extended
wrapping of `Dear ImGui`_.

Features include traditional GUI elements to display text, images and various controls,
such as buttons, radio buttons, and menus and various methods to create a functional and
beautiful layout. Additionally, it offers incredibly dynamic
charts, tables, drawings and tools for application development,
such as built-in documentation, logging, and debugger.

As a GUI toolkit, it is well suited for creating simple user interfaces
to wrap basic command line interfaces as well as to developing complex and
demanding graphical interfaces. It offers a solid framework for developing science,
engineering, games, data science and other applications that require fast and interactive interfaces.
